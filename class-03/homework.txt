Homework from class 3:

Create an express application with 4 routes and a not found handler
Route 1 should be a GET route that returns an object as a response;
Route 2 should be a POST route that throws a 400 error when there is no body
Route 3 should be a PUT route that throws a 400 error when there is no request parameters (id) or no body
Route 4 should be a DELETE route that throws a 400 error if there is no request parameters
